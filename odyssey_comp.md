1    Tell me, oh Muse, of a manifold man         | Ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, Μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ
     Who left to wander the world,               | 
2    Having sacked the great city of Troy.       | πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσε·
     
3    Many people and cities he saw               | πολλῶν δ’ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω,
     And learned many judgements.                | 
     
4    And many were pains that he suffered        | πολλὰ δ’ ὅ γ’ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν,
     As he sailed the seas,                      |
5    Seeking to save own life                    | ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων. 
     And provide safe return to his comrades.    |
     
     But no matter the toil,                     | ἀλλ' οὐδ' ὧς ἑτάρους ἐρρύσατο, ἱέμενός περ·
     They could not be saved from themselves,    |
