Tell me, oh Muse, of a manifold man
Who left to wander the world,
Having sacked the great city of Troy.

Many people and cities he saw 
And learned many judgements.
And many were pains that he suffered
As he sailed the seas,
Seeking to save own life
And provide safe return to his comrades.

But no matter the toil,
They could not be saved from themselves,
